                <h2>My Tech Journey: A 2-Year Roadmap</h2>
                <p>In the summer of 2024, I stood at the crossroads of ambition and opportunity, ready to embark on a thrilling journey into the world of technology. With a creative spark and a determination to make a mark, I envisioned a two-year roadmap that would transform my dreams into reality.
                </p>

                <h2>Year 1: Laying the Foundations
                </h2>
                <p>The first year was all about building a solid foundation. I started by diving deep into front-end development, mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With each line of code, I felt the thrill of creating something out of nothing. My first milestone was a personal website—a digital canvas that showcased my skills, goals, and aspirations. This website became my platform, a place where I could share my journey and connect with like-minded tech enthusiasts.
                    I also applied for the <strong>HNG Internship</strong>, a challenging program designed to push my limits and expand my horizons. The front-end task I tackled there was a test of my abilities and creativity, and I poured my heart into making it responsive and visually appealing. It was a taste of the real world, where attention to detail and user experience were paramount.
                </p>
                <h2>Year 2: Expanding Horizons</h2>
                <p>
                 My goal for the second year is to ventured into back-end development, learning languages like Python and frameworks such as Django. This new skill set allowed me to build more complex and dynamic web applications, broadening my understanding of how different components of a website interact.
                </p>
                <strong>In the words of Steve Jobs, "Stay hungry, stay foolish." My roadmap to tech may have been mapped out for two years, but my curiosity and passion will keep driving me forward, always eager to learn, create, and grow.</strong>
